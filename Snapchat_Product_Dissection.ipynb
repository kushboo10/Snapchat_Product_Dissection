        "Snapchat was founded in 2011 by **Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown**. It quickly became popular for its unique idea of sending photos and videos that disappear after viewing. Snapchat is especially popular among younger users and is known for its focus on **privacy, creativity, and fun communication**.\n",

        "### Key Highlights:\n",
        "- Disappearing photos and videos (Snaps)\n",
        "- Stories that last 24 hours\n",
        "- Snap Map for location sharing\n",
        "- Streaks to keep friends engaged daily\n",
        "- Augmented Reality (AR) filters and lenses\n",

        "1. **Permanent digital footprint** → Snaps disappear automatically, giving users more privacy.\n",
        "2. **Boring online interactions** → Fun AR filters, Bitmojis, and lenses make conversations lively.\n",
        "3. **Lack of close daily connections** → Snapstreaks encourage friends to interact every day.\n",
        "4. **Overly public sharing on other platforms** → Stories and private Snaps allow more control over who sees your content."

        "Snapchat changed the way people communicate online by making conversations more private, fun, and short-lived. Its unique features like disappearing Snaps, AR filters, and Snapstreaks keep users engaged in a playful way. The schema design and ER diagram show how entities like Users, Snaps, Stories, Friends, and Chats connect together. This project helped me understand how Snapchat’s data structure supports its features and overall success.\n",
