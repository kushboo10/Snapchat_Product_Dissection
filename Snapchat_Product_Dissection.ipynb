        "#Introduction:\n",
        "Snapchat is not just another social media app. It is a camera-first communication platform that focuses on sharing quick photos and videos called Snaps. These Snaps disappear after being viewed, which makes users feel more relaxed and free compared to other platforms where everything stays forever. This unique idea of temporary content has made Snapchat popular among young people who value fun and privacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 1: Company Overview\n",
        "Snapchat was founded in 2011 by **Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown**. It quickly became popular for its unique idea of sending photos and videos that disappear after viewing. Snapchat is especially popular among younger users and is known for its focus on **privacy, creativity, and fun communication**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Highlights:\n",
        "- Disappearing photos and videos (Snaps)\n",
        "- Stories that last 24 hours\n",
        "- Snap Map for location sharing\n",
        "- Streaks to keep friends engaged daily\n",
        "- Augmented Reality (AR) filters and lenses\n",
        "- Discover for news and trending content\n",
        "Snaps - allow private, casual sharing without permanence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stories - let users highlight moments for a day without cluttering chats.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lenses and Filters - make selfies and content fun, while also being a big source of brand revenue.\n",
        "\n",
        "Snap Map - helps users connect socially and discover local events.\n",
        "\n",

        "Snapchat was designed to solve real-world communication problems:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Permanent digital footprint** - Snaps disappear automatically, giving users more privacy.\n",
        "2. **Boring online interactions** - Fun AR filters, Bitmojis, and lenses make conversations lively.\n",
        "3. **Lack of close daily connections** - Snapstreaks encourage friends to interact every day.\n",
        "4. **Overly public sharing on other platforms** - Stories and private Snaps allow more control over who sees your content.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Real-World Problems Solved\n",
        "One of the biggest problems people faced on other social media apps was the pressure of permanent posts. Snapchat solved this by making Snaps disappear after being viewed. This simple feature created a safer space for quick, casual communication. Another problem was the lack of creativity in messaging. Snapchat introduced AR lenses and filters to make conversations more expressive and fun. Finally, it gave creators a stage with Spotlight, solving the problem of visibility for small creators."

        "### Case 1: Casual & Private Conversations\n",
        "- **Problem:** Social media messages felt permanent and risky.\n",
        "- **Solution:** Snapchat introduced disappearing messages and Snaps that vanish after viewing. This gave users the freedom to chat without worrying about long-term consequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Case 2: Making Chats Fun\n",
        "- **Problem:** Text-based communication felt plain.\n",
        "- **Solution:** Snapchat added AR lenses, Bitmojis, and filters, making interactions more engaging and creative.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Case 3: Staying Connected Daily\n",
        "- **Problem:** People wanted a fun way to keep in touch with close friends.\n",
        "- **Solution:** Snapchat created Snapstreaks, which motivate friends to send Snaps every day, building consistency and bonding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine a student who wants to send a funny AR selfie to friends but does not want it to stay online forever. On Snapchat, they open the camera, pick a lens, take a Snap, and send it. The Snap is delivered instantly, and once viewed, it disappears. Snapchat still keeps track of who viewed it and when, so the sender has some visibility. This process shows how Snapchat balances privacy (disappearing content) with analytics (view logs)."

Its unique features like disappearing Snaps, AR filters, and Snapstreaks keep users engaged in a playful way.
